**`CompSci Student`**

I'm a 21 year old dude from germany, who started programming in the beginning of 2020. I used this github profile as a way to store the little programming exercises/projects I had to do for school. Because of this, at least for the time being, there won't be anything wildly interesting to look at on this profile. Feel free to wander around and look what an A-level student in Germany does in his computer science class.
Below are some languages and tools I have used in the past.
